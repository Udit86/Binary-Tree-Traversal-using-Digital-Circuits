# Binary-Tree-Traversal-using-Digital-Circuits
This Repository contains a simulation of Digital Circuit for  Binary Tree Traversal. 

The "Binary_Tree_Reader.dsn" file contains the design file that runs in **Proteus Software**. 

The Binary Tree is stored in Binary file (.bin format) which is given as input to ROM.

An example "digi.bin" file is given that contains the Binary Tree mention in the task.

Such a Binary file can be created by the python code given in "binary.py"

The Digital Circuit shown in "Binary_Tree_Reader.dsn" reads the Binary Tree using a normal BFS algorithm and perform some computation to met the given task for calculating the minimum fuel cost at various cities(represented here as nodes).
The description of the task is given [here](Task_Description.pdf).
