# Binary-Tree-Traversal-using-Digital-Circuits
This Repository contains a simulation of Digital Circuit for  Binary Tree Traversal. 

The Binary Tree is stored in Binary file (.bin format) which is given as input to ROM. 
The Digital Circuit shown here reads the Binary Tree using a normal BFS algorithm and perform some computation to met the given task for calculating the minimum fuel cost at various cities(represented here as nodes).
The description of the task is given here.
